                  <AccordionContent>
                    The General Product Safety Regulation (GPSR) is an EU
                    regulation that replaces the General Product Safety
                    Directive (GPSD). It aims to ensure that all consumer
                    products sold in the EU market are safe. GPSR introduces
                    stricter requirements for manufacturers, importers, and
                    online sellers, with special focus on product traceability
                    and accountability.

                    GPSR will be fully enforced starting December 13, 2024.
                    However, companies are encouraged to prepare for compliance
                    well in advance of this deadline.

                    GPSR applies to all businesses involved in the supply chain
                    of consumer products sold in the EU market. This includes
                    manufacturers, importers, distributors, and online
                    marketplaces. If you sell products to EU consumers,
                    regardless of where your business is located, you need to
                    comply with GPSR.

                  <AccordionContent>
                    GPSR covers almost all consumer products, with some
                    exceptions for products already covered by specific sectoral
                    legislation (e.g., medical devices, pharmaceuticals, food).
                    Generally, if you sell consumer goods like clothing, toys,
                    electronics, household items, or similar products, they are
                    likely covered by GPSR.

                    Non-compliance with GPSR can result in severe penalties,
                    including fines of up to 4% of annual turnover in the EU or
                    â‚¬10 million (whichever is higher), product recalls, and
                    market access restrictions. In addition, non-compliance can
                    damage your brand reputation and lead to loss of consumer
                    trust.

                    An EU Authorized Representative is a legally designated
                    entity based in the European Union that acts on behalf of
                    non-EU manufacturers or sellers to fulfill certain
                    regulatory obligations. Under GPSR, non-EU economic
                    operators must designate an Authorized Representative in the
                    EU to ensure compliance with the regulation.

                    If you are a manufacturer, importer, or seller based outside

                    the EU. If your business is already established in the EU,
                    you typically don&apos;t need an Authorized Representative.

                    A &quot;product type&quot; refers to a group of products
                    that share the same essential characteristics, have
                    identical safety considerations, and can be covered by the
                    same technical documentation. For example, t-shirts in
                    different colors and sizes would be considered one product
                    type, while t-shirts and jeans would be two different
                    product types.

                    When your trial period ends, you&apos;ll need to select a
                    paid plan to continue using our services. We&apos;ll send
                    you reminders as your trial approaches its end date. If you
                    choose not to subscribe, your account will be limited but
                    not deleted, so you can easily reactivate it in the future.

                  <AccordionContent>
                    Yes, you can cancel your trial at any time without any
                    charges. Since we don&apos;t collect payment information
                    during the trial signup, there&apos;s nothing to cancel from
                    a billing perspective. You can simply stop using the
                    service, or you can explicitly cancel your trial in your
                    account settings if you wish.

                    The standard trial period is 14 days. In some cases, we may
                    offer extensions for customers who need more time to
                    evaluate our services. Contact our support team if you need
                    to request an extension of your trial period.

                    We take data security extremely seriously. Our platform uses
                    industry-standard encryption for all data transmission and
                    storage. We implement strict access controls, regular
                    security audits, and comply with GDPR and other relevant
                    data protection regulations. Your business and product
                    information is never shared with third parties without your
                    explicit consent.

                    Yes, you can cancel your subscription at any time. For
                    monthly plans, your service will continue until the end of
                    the current billing period. For annual plans, we offer a
                    30-day money-back guarantee for new subscribers. Please note
                    that if you cancel, we will no longer serve as your
                    Authorized Representative, and you&apos;ll need to make
                    alternative arrangements to maintain GPSR compliance.
